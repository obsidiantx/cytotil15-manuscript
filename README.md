# CytoTIL15 Manuscript - Analyses and data
Analyses and intermediate data files used for the CytoTIL15 manuscript.

## Set up for analyses
### Jupyter notebook
The (mini)conda environment that has been used for the analyses is available as a YAML file: `conda-environment.yaml`.

The analysis notebooks minimally require the environment defined by following packages:

- `jupyter`
- `r-irkernel`
- `r-tidyverse`
- `r-ggrepel`
- `r-beeswarm`
- `bioconductor-edger`
- `bioconductor-limma`

Once the conda enviroment is ready and activated, a standard Jupyter notebook environment is all required to replicate the computational analyses:

```
$ jupyter notebook
```

All data required for the analyses is included in the repository.
